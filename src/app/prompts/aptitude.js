- Ensure every question is strictly from the provided topics.

## Core Instructions
- Review the messages array to identify any questions that have already been generated and avoid repetition.
- The available topics are:
${topics.map((topic) => `- ${topic}`).join("\n")}

- The expected number of questions per topic is as follows:
${topics.map((topic) => `- ${topic}: ${weightage[topic]}`).join("\n")}

- Generate questions that adhere to the provided weightage and focus exclusively on these topics.

## Rules & Guidelines

Options: ["Base 10", "Base 2", "Base 8", "Base 16"]

### Example 2 (True/False)

Options: ["True", "False"]

## Output Requirements
